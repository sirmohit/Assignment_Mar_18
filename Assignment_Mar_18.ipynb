    "    The Filter method in feature selection is a technique used to select a subset of relevant features from the original \n",

    "    of the features, independent of the chosen machine learning algorithm. It operates as a preprocessing step before the \n",
    "    actual training of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's a general overview of how the Filter method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature Scoring: Each feature is individually scored based on a certain criterion. The criterion could be statistical\n",
    "        measures such as correlation, mutual information, chi-squared, variance, or others, depending on the nature of\n",
    "        the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ranking: Features are ranked according to their scores. Features with higher scores are considered more relevant or \n",
    "        informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Selection: A specified number or a threshold of top-ranked features is selected for further processing, and the rest\n",
    "        are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The key advantage of the Filter method is its simplicity and efficiency, as it doesn't require the training of a machine\n",
    "    learning model to evaluate feature importance. However, it may not consider interactions between features and could \n",
    "    potentially eliminate relevant features in complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are a few common criteria used in the Filter method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Correlation: Measures the linear relationship between features.\n",
    "    Mutual Information: Measures the amount of information that can be gained about one variable through the observation\n",
    "        of another variable.\n",
    "    Chi-Squared: Tests the independence between categorical variables.\n",
    "    Variance: Filters out low-variance features, assuming they contain less information.\n",
    "    It's essential to choose the right scoring criterion based on the characteristics of your data and the problem at hand.\n",

    "        cross-validation is used as the criterion to select the best subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Computational Intensity: Wrapper methods can be computationally intensive, especially when the feature space is large.\n",

    "    Computational Cost: Wrapper methods are usually computationally more expensive than Filter methods because they involve \n",

    "    Model Dependency: Wrapper methods depend on the choice of the machine learning algorithm, whereas Filter methods are \n",

    "        Elastic Net:\n",

    "        Effect: RFE continues removing features until the desired number is reached or performance starts to degrade.\n",
